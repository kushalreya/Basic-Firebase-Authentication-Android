# 🔐 Authentication Lab

A modern Android authentication application built using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **MVVM**, and **Firebase Authentication**.

This project demonstrates a production-inspired authentication flow with clean architecture principles, reactive UI using StateFlow & SharedFlow, and proper separation of concerns. It serves as both a learning project and a portfolio application showcasing Android development best practices.

---

# 📱 App Overview

This is an Android application that demonstrates how to build a scalable authentication system using Firebase Authentication and Jetpack Compose.

Instead of simply implementing login functionality, this project focuses on building authentication using real-world Android architecture with proper separation between UI, business logic, and data layers.

### Problem it solves

Many beginner authentication projects tightly couple Firebase APIs with UI code, making them difficult to maintain and extend.

This project demonstrates a clean and scalable approach using MVVM, Repository Pattern, Data Source abstraction, reactive state management, and centralized UI event handling.

# 🛠 Tech Stack

### Language

- Kotlin

### UI

- Material 3

### Architecture

- MVVM
- Repository Pattern
- Data Source Pattern

# 🏗 Architecture

The application follows the MVVM architecture with a Repository and Data Source layer to keep Firebase implementation details isolated from the UI.

A[Compose UI]
--> B[ViewModel]

B --> C[Repository]

C --> D[Firebase Data Source]

D --> E[Firebase Authentication]
```

### Layer Responsibilities

**UI**

- Displays state
- Sends user actions to ViewModel
- Observes StateFlow and SharedFlow

**ViewModel**

- Business logic
- State management
- UI event emission
- Authentication flow

**Repository**

- Converts Firebase models into application models
- Handles authentication operations

**Data Source**

- Direct communication with Firebase Authentication SDK

---

# 🔄 App Flow

1. User launches the application.
2. Existing authentication session is checked.
3. If authenticated, user is navigated to the Home screen.
4. Otherwise, Login screen is displayed.
5. User can Login or Register using Email & Password.
6. Authentication request is sent to Firebase.
7. Repository maps Firebase models into application models.
8. ViewModel updates authentication state.
9. UI reacts automatically to state changes.
10. Errors are displayed using centralized Snackbars.

# 🌐 API Integration

### Firebase Authentication

Used for:

- User Registration
- User Login
- User Logout
- Session Persistence

### Data Flow

```
UI
 ↓
ViewModel
 ↓
Repository
 ↓
Firebase Data Source
 ↓
Firebase Authentication
```

### Error Handling

- Firebase exceptions are mapped into user-friendly messages.
- Errors are emitted as one-time UI events using SharedFlow.
- Snackbars are displayed from a centralized location in the application.
